# Building Your Mouseless Development Environment - Behind the Scene

This is the Makefile and the tools I used for my book [Building Your Mouseless Development Environment](https://themouseless.dev).

You need to have installed:

* [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
* [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)
* [ebook-converter (from Calibre)](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/generated/en/ebook-convert.html)
* [TeX Live](https://tug.org/texlive/) ([Arch Wiki - TeX Live](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/TeX_Live))
* [pandoc-latex-environment](https://github.com/chdemko/pandoc-latex-environment)

If you have a problem or a question, please open a new issue and try to be as descriptive as possible.
